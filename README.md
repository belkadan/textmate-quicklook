# TMQuickLook #

Adds Quick Look functionality to the [TextMate][] project outline view. Requires Mac OS X v10.6. Compatible with plugins like [MissingDrawer][].

To install, download [TMQuickLook.tmplugin][] to `~/Library/Application Support/TextMate/PlugIns` and relaunch TextMate. (You should create that folder if it doesn't already exist.)

Bug reports welcome!
